The KyGovMaps [Open Data Portal](https://opengisdata.ky.gov/) is another great resource for vector data sources.  This is also the place you want to visit for **Metadata**, especially since the [KyGeoPortal](https://kygeoportal.ky.gov) will retire in October 2025.

This is javascript-based [Explorer](https://kyfromabove.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html)  serves the kyfromabove aws bucket as an explorer-like environment.  This is a great resource to download files if you already know the name of the file.  Also, it also contains links to tile grids in Geopackage formats that can be view in desktop software, python, online viewers, and so on.
