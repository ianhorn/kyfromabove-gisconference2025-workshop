# Getting Started

For this exercise, you will need to choose a platform for which you can run a python notebook.  Examples include but are not limited to:

- [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - Easy Setup
- [SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/) - Must already have an account - takes time to get approved
 - Local Jupyter - recommended only for experienced python users
    - using a conda/mamba environment
    - using a virtual environment with pip (e.g., python -m venv myenv + pip install jupyter)

For for the purposes of the workshop, I recomment most users use **MyBinder**.  When launched, if will build the environment we need to get started.
